# OpenNEM Connector
The OpenNEM project aims to make the wealth of public National Electricity Market (NEM) data more accessible to a wider audience.

We hope that improved access will facilitate better public understanding of the market, improve energy literacy and help facilitate a more informed national discussion on Australiaâ€™s energy transition in the long term interests of consumers.

By providing a clear window on the data, we hope to address the information asymmetry between stakeholders and improve the productivity of those engaged in energy market discussions..

## Known Issues and Limitations
Required. Include any known issues and limitations a user may encounter.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Why have you not added the other application endpoints?
My intent here was to write flows that would look for application registrations with soon to be expiring client secrets. If you would like see other endpoints added, let me know or submit changes to this connector via guthub. 

### How to I create a client ID and secret?
Register an application in Azure AD and grant it delegated Application.Read.All access to the Microsoft Graph Service (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0).

## Deployment Instructions
Create a new application registration in Azure AD and enable API access to the Microsoft Graph with Application.Read.All for Delegated permissions.
After downloading the connector, edit the client ID and tenant ID in apiProperties.json to your app registration and tenant. 
Please use paconn CLI to deploy.
